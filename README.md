# XRay-Pneumonia-Classifier

## Project Description (TODO: needs to be expanded)
The goal of this project is so classify the presence of pneumonia in a patient based off their chest x-ray. There are 3 different examples in the dataset (normal, bacterial pneumonia, and viral pneumonia). Our initial goal is to classify the yes/no question for if a patient has malaria. We will research a variety of models to see what is the most effective.

## Dataset
Available on Kaggle [1]. 5863 labelled x-ray images from a frontal view. There are 2 categories of normal/pneumonia.
